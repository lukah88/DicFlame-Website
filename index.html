		<p1 id="pol1"> 
			Big Governmnet is only good for one thing, that is destroying individual freedom. It is high time we shrink the Federal Government, get rid of useless regulations and cut the number of employees. 
		</p1>
		<p2 id="pol2">
			"All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States". Only congress can make laws, the fact that we have agencies such as the AFT, the CDC, and the FDA, making laws for the United States, is a violation of the Constituion. Lets abolish these Illegal ABC agencies. 
		</p2>
		<p3 id="pol3"> 
			There is nothing more fundementaly unfair, then our tex codes. Let's repeal the Federal income tax, replace it with a stnadard national sales tax, and get hard working American's money back in their pockets.
		</p3>
		<p4 id="pol4"> 
			Each day more and more hard earned American dollars are given to foreign nations. Is it time we get American money out of foreign nations, and back to the American people. We need to stop unlimted foreign aid programs, and get the US out of nations we should have no interest in.
